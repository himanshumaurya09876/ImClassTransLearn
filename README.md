# Image Classifier using Transfer Learning
<li>A DL based project that classifies an image into Cat, Dog, Horse or Human.</li>
<li>Used Transfer Learning due to shortage of data.</li>
<li>Imported the architecture and weights of ResNet50 pretrained CNN model which is trained on a very very large ImageNet dataset.</li>
<li>Got a very high accuracy even with very small dataset.</li>
